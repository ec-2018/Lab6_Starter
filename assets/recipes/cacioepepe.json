What's the point of tearing into every recipe and pointing out perceived flaws, without even trying it? Who cares if it's authentic? Since when do we insist on purism? If you want authentic, ask a Roman cook or google the recipe."

While you're right that butter isn't traditional, I think we can take a step back from Italy's hyper-regionalism and admit that olive oil is hardly the blasphemy you make it out to be.\n\n@Deb4747 So you're telling me the original home of \"Cacio e Pepe\" (which literally translates to \"cheese and pepper\") doesn't use pepper? The cheese is most definitely pecorino. Why even leave this comment?"

I followed the recipe, and kept the heat down. I was confused about the pan with the pepper oil mixture, but just put it off the burner while cooking the pasta, then placed the pan back on a burner at its lowest setting. I used ground cheese. It was magnificent! No protein smears on the pan, and creamy. I had it with a Panzanella salad I made this afternoon, and a glass of a red blend. There was enough for a second helping too, which I enjoyed nearly as much as the first. Thanks!"
